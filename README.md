ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, Bootstrap, and Next.js. I recently completed a two-month frontend development internship, where I worked on building responsive and user-friendly web interfaces.

ðŸ’» I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies, especially in modern JavaScript frameworks and UI/UX development. Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in Next.js and expanding my knowledge in full-stack development.

ðŸš€ I love collaborating on open-source projects, solving challenging problems, and continuously improving my coding skills. Feel free to connect with me or check out my repositories
